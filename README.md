# LUDO-GAME
🎲 Ludo Game in Python
This project is a Ludo Game implemented in Python, inspired by the classic board game loved by millions. It allows players to roll dice, move tokens, and compete to get all their pieces “home” before their opponents. The game logic is built using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to ensure clean, modular, and reusable code.
The Ludo board, dice rolls, and player movements are managed programmatically, with proper turn handling and win condition checks. The project simulates the real rules of Ludo — including safe zones, token unlocking on rolling a six, and circular board traversal.
Depending on the version, the game can be played in:
Console mode – a text-based interface showing dice rolls, moves, and board updates.
GUI mode (optional) – built using Tkinter or Pygame for an interactive graphical experience.
  This project demonstrates:
  Logical thinking and algorithmic design
  Use of classes and data structures for game management
Event handling and user interaction (in GUI version)
It’s a fun, educational project for practicing Python programming while recreating a classic board game experience!
